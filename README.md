gfw
===

it's a simple framework for making games. despite being 2/3 of the acronymed
title, "framework" might be a bit too strong. (for now.)


use
---

```PowerShell
jai gfw.jai
./gfw
```

start making a game by editing `main.jai`, which contains the program entry
point, and the the `simulate()` and `present()` functions ("update" and "draw")
that you'll want to use to make your game.

entities should be defined in files in `entities/`, which are `#load`ed
automatically when your game compiles.
